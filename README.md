# In this module, we will explore the practical application of integration testing within a test-driven development (TDD) framework.
# It will employ TDD, allowing participants to write tests before developing features, and experience hands-on experimentation.
# The project will utilize vTest and MSW for testing, as they are modern tools suited for Next.js applications and realistic API mocking.
